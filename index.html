      <blockquote>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and
        the order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of
        the
        person.

      <blockquote class="que">
        A people without the knowledge of their past history, origin and culture is like a tree without roots. <br> <br>
        Perhaps it is time to debate culture. The common story is that in "real" African culture, before it was tainted
        by the west, gender roles were rigid and women were contentedly oppressed. <br> <br>
        You cannot leave Africa. It is always with you, there inside your head.
